# Facial-Verification-with-Siamese-Network

In this project I intend to create a workflow that helps people use research papers for project development. My specific project involves building a deep facial recognition application for authentication in other applications. I will use TensorFlow to develop a model based on the approach described in the research paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition." Once the model is trained, I aim to integrate it smoothly into an application for seamless and effective authentication.
